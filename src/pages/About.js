      Iâ€™m someone who loves coffee almost as much as I love coding. I am excited about Generative AI, NLP and all things tech. I bring creativity, clarity, and code to the table. Curious by nature and relentless by habit, I'm always learning, always building. Outside of work, you'll find me geeking over food, dancing and writing poetry!
